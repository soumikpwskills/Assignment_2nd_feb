    "Ans :- **Class :-** A class is a user-defined layout or blueprint of an object that describes what a specific kind of object will look like. A class description consists of two things: \n",
    "1. Attributes or member variables, and \n",
    "2. Implementations of behavior or member functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**So in object-oriented terminology:** A class is a blueprint that defines the variables and the methods common to all objects of a certain kind. It helps us to bind data and methods together, making the code reusable, unlike procedural language.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a mobile phone has attributes like a brand name, RAM, and functions like texting and calling. Thus, the mobile phone is a class of various phones (the objects).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Object :-** An object is a single instance of a class, which contains data and methods working on that data. \n",
    "\n",
    "So an object consists of three things:\n",
    "1. Name: This is a variable name that represents the object.\n",
    "2. Member data: The data that describes the object.\n",
    "3. Member methods: Behavior that describes the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, Samsung Galaxy is an object with the brand name Samsung, 8GB RAM as properties, and calling and texting as behaviors."

Think of a car; the actual mechanism that keeps a car moving is hidden from the user. It is important to know how to drive a car; but it is not necessarily important to know what happens under the hood when you drive the car. Abstraction is about keeping the internal mechanics of the code hidden from the user. This reduces the complexity of the code, and ensures that we only concentrate on what is important.\n",
